# Tropical Cyclone Serverity Predicion Project
## Introduction 

### Project Context
Cyclones are powerful atmospheric phenomena that can cause severe destruction, loss of life, and significant economic damage. Accurate predictions of cyclone intensity are crucial because they help:

* Warn populations in advance, reducing casualties and property damage.
* Optimize emergency response measures, such as evacuations and infrastructure protection.
* Support insurance companies in risk assessment and disaster planning.
* Assist governments and organizations in making strategic decisions.
